I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas (Advisor: <a href="https://jessekim.com/"> Dr. Jin Ryong Kim </a>), specializing in `Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)`, `haptics`, and `virtual reality (VR)`. My research focuses on enhancing immersiveness and realism in virtual environments by combining advanced haptic technologies with insights into human perception.

A significant part of my work involves designing and prototyping multimodal systems that leverage perceptual illusions, such as thermal and tactile effects, to create intuitive and engaging user experiences. My passion lies in bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds through innovative and user-centric solutions.

As I approach the completion of my Ph.D., I am actively seeking research opportunities where I can apply my expertise in HCI, VR, and haptic design to solve real-world problems and contribute to impactful projects. I am excited to collaborate with teams that value creativity, innovation, and pushing the boundaries of technology.
