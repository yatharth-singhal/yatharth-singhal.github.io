abstract = {This paper presents a mid-air thermo-tactile feedback system using an ultrasound haptic display. We design a proof-of-concept thermo-tactile feedback system with an open-top chamber, heat modules, and an ultrasound display. Our approach is to provide heated airflow along the path to the focused pressure point created from the ultrasound display to generate thermal and vibrotactile cues in mid-air simultaneously. We confirm that our system can generate the thermo-tactile stimuli up to 54.2°C with 3.43 mN when the ultrasonic haptic signal was set to 100 Hz with a 12 mm radius of the cue size. We also confirm that our system can provide a stable temperature (mean error=0.25\%). We measure the warm detection threshold (WDT) and the heat-pain detection threshold (HPDT). The results show that the mean WDT was 32.8°C (SD=1.12), and the mean HPDT was 44.6°C (SD=1.64), which are consistent with the contact-based thermal thresholds. We also found that the accuracy of haptic pattern identification is similar for non-thermal (98.1\%) and thermal conditions (97.2\%), showing a non-significant effect of high temperature. We finally confirmed that thermo-tactile feedback further enhances the user experiences.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a thermal illusion called thermal masking. Thermal masking is a phenomenon induced by thermal referral to completely mask the original thermal sensation, providing thermal sensation only at the tactile site. Three experiments are conducted using thermal and vibrotactile actuators to investigate the nature of thermal masking on human arms. The first experiment investigates the effects of different temperatures on masking. The results show a higher percentage of thermal masking occurs in warm than hot or cold conditions. The second experiment examines how far the thermal masking can be perceived. The results show that masking can reach up to 24 cm from the thermal site. The third experiment explores the interaction space by placing the tactile actuators on the opposite side of the thermal actuator. The results confirm that thermal masking can reach the other side of the arm, and the performance was higher in warm conditions.},

abstract = {We examine mid-air typing data collected from touch typists to evaluate the features and classification models for recognizing finger stroke. A large number of finger movement traces have been collected using finger motion capture systems, labeled into individual finger strokes, and classified into several key features. We test finger kinematic features, including 3D position, velocity, acceleration, and temporal features, including previous fingers and keys. Based on this analysis, we assess the performance of various classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Deep Neural Networks, in terms of the accuracy for correctly classifying the keystroke. We finally incorporate a linguistic heuristic to explore the effectiveness of the character prediction model and improve the total accuracy.},

abstract = {We present Snow, a cross-modal interface that integrates cold and tactile stimuli in mid-air to create snowflakes and raindrops for VR experiences. Snow uses six Peltier packs and an ultrasound haptic display to create unique cold-tactile sensations for users to experience catching snowflakes and getting rained on their bare hands. Our approach considers humans' ability to identify tactile and cold stimuli without masking each other when projected onto the same location on their skin, making illusions of snowflakes and raindrops. We design both visual and haptic renderings to be tightly coupled to present snow melting and rain droplets for realistic visuo-tactile experiences. For multiple snowflakes and raindrops rendering, we propose an aggregated haptic scheme to simulate heavy snowfall and rainfall environments with many visual particles. The results show that the aggregated haptic rendering scheme demonstrates a more realistic experience than other schemes. We also confirm that our approach of providing cold-tactile cues enhances the user experiences in both conditions compared to other modality conditions.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel method for creating moving thermal sensations by integrating the thermal referral illusion with tactile motion. Conducted through three experiments on human forearms, the first experiment examined the impact of temperature and thermal actuator placement on perceived thermal motion, finding the clearest perception with a centrally positioned actuator under both hot and cold conditions. The second experiment identified the speed thresholds of perceived thermal motion, revealing a wider detectable range in hot conditions (1.8 cm/s to 9.5cm/s) compared to cold conditions (2.4cm/s to 5.0cm/s). Finally, we integrated our approach into virtual reality (VR) to assess its feasibility through two interaction scenarios. Our results shed light on the comprehension of thermal perception and its integration with tactile cues, promising significant advancements in incorporating thermal motion into diverse thermal interfaces for immersive VR experiences.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to render thermal and tactile feedback to the palm and fingertips through thermal and tactile integration. Our approach minimizes the obstruction of the palm and inner side of the fingers and enables virtual object manipulation while providing localized and global thermal feedback. By leveraging thermal actuators positioned strategically on the outer palm and back of the fingers in interplay with tactile actuators, our approach exploits thermal referral and tactile masking phenomena. Through a series of user studies, we validate the perception of localized thermal sensations across the palm and fingers, showcasing the ability to generate diverse thermal patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in VR applications, replicating diverse thermal interactions with virtual objects. This work represents significant progress in thermal interactions within VR, offering enhanced sensory immersion at an optimal energy cost.},
