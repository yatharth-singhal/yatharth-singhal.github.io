abstract = {We demonstrate an ultrasound haptic display-based mid-air thermo-tactile feedback system. We design a proof-of-concept thermo-tactile feedback system with an open-top chamber, heat modules, and an ultrasound display. Our method involves directing heated airflow toward the focused pressure point produced by the ultrasound display to deliver thermal and tactile cues in mid-air simultaneously. We present this system with three different virtual environments (CampFire, Water Fountain, and Kitchen) to show the rich user experiences of integrating thermal and tactile feedback.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a novel wearable thermal interface, designed and fabricated as a glove consisting of flexible thermoelectric devices (Peltier) and vibrotactile ERM motors. Our approach induced the thermal sensation through thermal and tactile integration by strategically placing the thermal actuator at the back side of the finger, presenting thermal feedback at the location of tactile actuators on the palmer side, and providing free hand manipulation. We showcase our system with two different VR environments: water faucet and magic fireball to illustrate the unique user experience of interacting with virtual objects.}

  abstract={We present a novel interaction technique called thermal motion, which creates an illusion of flowing thermal sensations by combining thermal and tactile actuators. This technique generates dynamic thermal referral illusions across multiple tactile points, making users perceive moving thermal cues. Our demonstration uses a sleeve form factor to illustrate this effect, effectively creating the illusion of moving thermal cues along usersâ€™ arms.},
