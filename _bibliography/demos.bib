abstract = {We demonstrate an ultrasound haptic display-based mid-air thermo-tactile feedback system. We design a proof-of-concept thermo-tactile feedback system with an open-top chamber, heat modules, and an ultrasound display. Our method involves directing heated airflow toward the focused pressure point produced by the ultrasound display to deliver thermal and tactile cues in mid-air simultaneously. We present this system with three different virtual environments (CampFire, Water Fountain, and Kitchen) to show the rich user experiences of integrating thermal and tactile feedback.},
